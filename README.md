## Goals & Motivation

- Contrast ratio should be high, but not too high.
- Keywords are better visual anchors than symbols - and should therefore be boldened and symbols made less visible.
- Comments should be non-intrusive and not draw too much attention - they must be both optional & pleasant to read.
  They should be usable both for documentation as well as sectioning off pieces of code.
- Textual content such as variables, parameters, etc. do not have any coloring unless necessary - colors should be reserved for context and special meaning.
- Color meaning should extend _beyond_ just the editor pane - non-editor coloring such as source control / git decorations & diagnostics are also important and should not look like editor colors.
